      "explanation": "To double, the interest earned (SI) must equal the principal (P). This takes 6 years. To become 4 times, the interest earned must be 3 times the principal (3P). Since the rate is constant, if earning P takes 6 years, earning 3P will take 3 × 6 = 18 years."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Let the usual speed be S and usual time be T. Distance = S×T. The new speed is (5/6)S and the new time is (T+10). So, S×T = (5/6)S × (T+10). Canceling S, we get T = (5/6)(T+10). 6T = 5T + 50. Therefore, T = 50 minutes."
