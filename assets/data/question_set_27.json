      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The formula for the difference for 2 years is P(R/100)². So, 1 = P(4/100)². This gives 1 = P(1/25)², which simplifies to 1 = P/625. Therefore, the principal (P) is Rs. 625."

      "explanation": "Let the distance be D. The time difference is (D/3) - (D/4) = 0.5 hours. Finding a common denominator: (4D - 3D) / 12 = 0.5. This simplifies to D/12 = 0.5. Therefore, D = 6 km."
