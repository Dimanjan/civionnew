Let's create a clearer one. If 'PENCIL' is 'QDOMJK', how is 'ERASER' written? P+1=Q, E-1=D, N+1=O, C-1=B... No. Let's stick to a simple one. If 'TABLE' is coded as 'UDEMG', how is 'CHAIR' coded? T+1=U, A+3=D, B+3=E, L+1=M, E+2=G. Not consistent. Let's use a simple shift. If 'PENCIL' is 'RGPEKN', then 'ERASER' is? P+2=R, E+2=G, N+2=P, C+2=E, I+2=K, L+2=N. Pattern is +2. ERASER -> GTCUGT."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "P+Q = 10100. Q+R = 12500. P+R = 10400. Adding all three gives 2(P+Q+R) = 33000, so P+Q+R = 16500. To find P, subtract (Q+R): P = (P+Q+R) - (Q+R) = 16500 - 12500 = Rs. 4000."
