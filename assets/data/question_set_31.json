      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Selling Price (SP) of Rs. 78 represents 104% of the Cost Price (CP). So, CP = 78 / 1.04 = Rs. 75. If the new SP is Rs. 60, the loss is 75 - 60 = Rs. 15. The loss percent is (Loss / CP) × 100 = (15 / 75) × 100 = 20%."

        "4.33%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Let SI=P/9, Time=R. Using the formula SI = (P×R×T)/100, we get P/9 = (P×R×R)/100. This simplifies to R² = 100/9. Taking the square root, R = 10/3 = 3.33%."

      "explanation": "Let the total number of workers be x. The total salary is 8000x. This equals the sum of the salaries of technicians and others: 8000x = (7 × 12000) + ((x-7) × 6000). 8000x = 84000 + 6000x - 42000. 2000x = 42000. So, x = 21."
