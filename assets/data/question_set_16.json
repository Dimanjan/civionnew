      "explanation": "Let CP of one article be Re 1. CP of 20 articles = Rs 20. This is the SP of 'x' articles. Profit is 25%, so SP of 20 articles = 20 × 1.25 = Rs 25. SP of one article = 25/20 = 1.25. Since SP of 'x' articles is Rs 20, then x = 20 / 1.25 = 16."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Let the rates be R1 and R2. The difference in interest is (P × T × (R1-R2)) / 100. So, 13.50 = (1500 × 3 × (R1-R2)) / 100. This simplifies to 13.50 = 45 × (R1-R2). The difference in rates (R1-R2) = 13.50 / 45 = 0.3%."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Let the total distance be D. The time taken is (D/2)/21 + (D/2)/24 = 10. This simplifies to D/42 + D/48 = 10. Finding a common denominator: (8D + 7D) / 336 = 10. So, 15D = 3360, and D = 224 km."

      "explanation": "The winner got 55% of valid votes, so the loser got 45%. The difference is 10%, which equals 2000 votes. Total valid votes = 2000 × 10 = 20000. These valid votes represent 80% of total votes polled. Total votes = 20000 / 0.80 = 25000."
